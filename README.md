# Project 0

The `src` directory contains the source code for the project; use
the `Makefile` to build it.  The executable will be added to the
`bin` directory.  There are some sample input files in the `tests`
directory.

**NOTE:** you must have the location of SML/NJ in your shell `PATH`
variable for the bild chain to work.
